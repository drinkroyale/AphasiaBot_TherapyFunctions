This is Group 1 of 12 STEM 9B, presenting our project called the "Aphasia Bot"!

What the project does
    The Aphasia Bot is a computer-based therapy tool designed to assist patients with aphasia in 
    improving their communication(talking, word, sentence completion therapy) and reading 
    comprehension (repeat, and speech therapy). It provides intensive therapy sessions that can be
    conducted at home or in a clinic.

Why the project is useful
    This tool helps Filipinos suffering from aphasia, a condition that affects communication abilities. 
    It aims to bring more attention to aphasia, which currently lacks sufficient research and care in 
    the country.

How users can get started with the project
    By engaging with our interactive and entertaining bot, we hope to educate and support aphasia 
    patients. The bot creates such connections not only with the patient but also with others who
    may benefit from its use.
